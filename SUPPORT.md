## Report a Bug or submit a Feature Request

Have you found a bug in Review Hub or do you want to suggest a new feature? Either way, please let us know by filing an issue while observing the following guidelines.

### Look for an existing issue

Before submitting your issue please search the [issues](https://github.com/microsoft/review-hub/issues) to ensure your issue has not already been reported.

If your bug or feature request has already been reported, join the conversation by commenting and adding your reaction. Please use reactions to vote and not "+1" comments.

- File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
- Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.
- The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.
- Observe the inline guidelines of the Issue template.
